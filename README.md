## Resume Page by [@Skn0tt](https://github.com/Skn0tt)
Leonids features a simple resume page. It is divided up into five sections:

* Bio (Edit \_data/index/careers.yml)
* Education (Edit \_data/index/education.yml)
* Skills (Edit \_data/index/skills.yml)
* Projects (Edit \_data/index/projects.yml)
* About (Edit \_includes/sections/about.html)

You can put all your info into these files, and they will be featured on the resume page.

## TODO

- [ ] timeline
- [ ] portfolio summary page
