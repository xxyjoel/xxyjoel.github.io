## Overview
While researching farming & gardening methods I stumbled upon aquaponics - a blend of [aquaculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture) and [hydroponics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponics) and became enamored with its potential. It seemed to promise the ability to rid our dependency of pesticides, water and soil while increasing productivity and crop yield. If the method seems to promise everything shy of terraforming capabilities, where is the ubiquity?   

## What *is* Aquaponics?
[Aquaponics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaponics) refers to any system that combines conventional aquaculture (raising aquatic animals such as snails, fish, crayfish or prawns in tanks) with hydroponics (cultivating plants in water) in a symbiotic environment. In normal aquaculture, excretions from the animals being raised can accumulate in the water, increasing toxicity. In an aquaponic system, water from an aquaculture system is fed to a hydroponic system where the by-products are broken down by nitrifying bacteria initially into nitrites and subsequently into nitrates that are utilized by the plants as nutrients. Then, the water is recirculated back to the aquaculture system. 

Given the nature of a closed-loop ecosystem, creating an effecient, self-sustaining, commercially viable aquaponic farm is essentially a large optimization problem - where where all subsystems must remain in balance in order to prevent ecosystem failure. 

Apart from the system design and the variables associated, it is worth discussing the economic viability given climate change risk factors - such as an increase in disease, pest and extreme weather phenomena, general population growth (specifically in urban areas) and soil depletion rates - if commercial aquaponic systems are viable alternative to standard soil-based farming techniques.  

## System designs 
Standard "aquaponic system designs" resemble something like this [aquaponicswork.com](http://aquaponicswork.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/free-aquaponics-system-plans-3.png)

Primary componets include:
* sump tank - primary collection and distribution point for all water
* water heater - to maintain water temp
* grow beds - self explanatory 
* substrate type - soil replacement
* filters - swirl / small particulate 

A "flood and drain" process is used to transfer nutrients and to the roots and provide sufficient ventilation for growth. There are many different substrate types that are optimum for specifc vegitation and flexibility of greenhouse design may be limited due to substrate mass.

### Variables
Quick overview of the non-economic variables associated with an aquaponic design: 
* light - how much is required for your vegetation? what light spectrum is optimum? how much direct sunlight can be used? How much needs to be supplemented with LEDs? 
* water - nitrate, nitrite, pH, ammonia, pressure, temperature, etc. 
 * this needs to be balanced for both fish and plants. optimums may differ
* airflow
* bacterial relationships
* substrate type(s) - mass & greenhouse architecture, water 
* germination 
* fish - type for system, diets, water temp, etc. 
* vegetation type

Additional economic variables:
* value of produce in geographic region
* yield / production rate
* transportation cost
* electricity costs (heat, light, airflow)  
* water costs (minimal) 
* labor (harvesting) 

## Economic Viability 
There is not a lot of information on the ROI timelines of aquaponic systems. I assume becuase the technology required to commercially scale these systems has, until recently remained cost prohibitive (e.g. LED lights). Additionally, many companies offering aquaponic based products also offer consulting services. Presumably, given the quantity of consultants relative to aquaponic farmers, it is more lucrative to consult than produce. 

Recent reports suggest profitability, while dependent on many factors such as geography and climate, is primarily dependent upon whether or not the farmer is able to offer (and charge for) organic products. [Journal of Applied Agriculture](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1v4vkSDpuGp3ewyujlglsggn1LdfpC5tW) 

Further analysis show that labor, regardless of farm size, equates to 2/3 of total farm operational costs. If one was able to structure the greenhouse / farm is such a way where automated harvesting is a viable solution, aquaponic farming costs could begin to compete with non-organic produce.
