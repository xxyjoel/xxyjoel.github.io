## Random – what is it and why does it exist? 

I got into an argument with a friend over the definition of random and whether or not exists – his argument, which technically true, was not sufficient. 

Argument: The definition of ‘random’ is ‘random’. 

While yes, if you type ‘definition of random’ into your search bar, the result is google returning: 
[insert definition of random picture]

But to me this was no different than the argument for the existence of a higher being. “It exists because it exists!” Or better yet, “it exists because [insert currently unexplained rationale for unrelated event A]” Random is the currently unexplained rationale for an event, or variance. The features not included in the model. The currently uncalculatable variance in your prediction. “So you’re saying given infinite time and compute random would not exist?” 

Not quite.

When you predict something and subsequently act on that prediction you are changing the state of that thing. Take climate change for example; we are predicting climate change to cause harm to the planet and her citizens. We take action to prevent this change. These subsequent actions reduce the accuracy of the original prediction.  

Predictions are a way of saying, “if all states and factors remained the same, this is what the new, future state would look like in n time periods”. Random exists and will continue to exists because of the relationship between cause and effect. 

## Intelligence - how do you define it?  

While we still have much to learn about the human brain, effective learning methods and intelligence type, cognitive theory has always fascinated me. As a society we seem to broadly categorize intelligence as “the ability to achieve ones goals” 

Building off of that definition, there three types of problem-solving methods that aid in goal or task completion: (1) crystalized, (2) fluid, and (3) emotional. 

Crystalized being your ‘book smarts’ – this is knowledge or skills learned that have been reapplied (replicated) in a new environment. Fluid being your ‘street smarts’ – the ability to perform well in unfamiliar situations, solving an unknown or previously unsolved a task. Emotional – one’s ability to empathize and form connections.     

Because the information available to us currently is far superior to the information available in times past, I would add that the ability to index and search is becoming increasingly valuable. No longer is it necessary to have memorized swaths of detailed information – you need only be able to search and apply. While I still believe there is immense value in truly understanding the fundamentals of why something works or behaves, knowing every detail is not only unnecessary, it is risky if you want to maintain personal growth in an organization.
