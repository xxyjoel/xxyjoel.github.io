## overview 
a study-material list i believe to be "sources of truth" on their respective topics; it is not enough for an analytics professional to simply 'generate insights'; the professional must be able to (1) describe and communicate insights and recommendations and (2) have intelligent discussions as to how the model(s) should be designed and supported in production; required expertise (or familiarity) in the following subjects: 

* general scientific methods (how to setup, run, qualify and ensure experiment reporducibility)
* maths, statistics, probability theory, et al  
* scripting & package knowledge (Python, R and respective packages)
* visualization  (packages, reporting tools, etc.)
* computer science / programming basics (version control, testing framework, design standards, etc.)
* data engineering (how are you ingesting, transforming and updating your data feed)
* cloud architecture (where / how are your models going to be supported?)

given the pace at which technology is ever-changing, there should be a portion of ones time spent, to use a nn reference, "exloring" versus exploiting the current mastered skill sets; certain tools may solve a problem more effecienty with minimum time investment (e.g. shiny versus tableau or power bi mastery)  

## topics  
* [data scientist roadmap](https://github.com/MrMimic/data-scientist-roadmap) - really well done repo by [MrMimic](https://github.com/MrMimic) that outlines fundamentals in various areas 
* [statistics fundamentals](https://www.statlect.com/fundamentals-of-statistics) - modules ranging from point estimation to bayesian inference 
* [python best practices, green tea press](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html) - how to think like a (python) computer scientist 
* [hitchhikers guide to python, o'reilly](https://docs.python-guide.org/) - environment setup standards and generally how to write great python code 
* [hundred page machine learning book](http://themlbook.com/) - Andriy is nice enough to offer this book on a 'read first, buy later' principal; i eneded up purchasing the paperback copy... because why wouldnt you want to support people doing good for the community? 
* [hundred page machine learning book - data & code samples](https://github.com/aburkov/theMLbook) - the code to go with the hundred page ml book's examples
* [ml prod deployment methods](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/06/approaches-deploying-machine-learning-production.html) - overview of some deployment methods with varying environments & scenarios 
* [ml evaluation methods p1](https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/files/evaluating-machine-learning-models.pdf) - overview of basic evaluation metrics and methods for common model application scenarios 
* [ml evaluation methods p2](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dpage/cs760/evaluating.pdf) - overview of basic evaluation metrics and methods for common model application scenarios 
* [application scenarios](https://github.com/firmai/industry-machine-learning) - i have linked to this before in previous posts, however, it is useful to understand *where* to apply the tools in your toolbox and [firmai](https://github.com/firmai) provides the best list i have found to date
